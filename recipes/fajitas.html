 <h2>Ingredients</h2>
 <ul>
  <li>2 tablespoons chili powder</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon cumin</li>
  <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon Mexican oregano</li>
  <li>1 ½ pounds chicken breasts, cut into strips.</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
  <li>1 red onion, peeled and cut into ½-inch wedges</li>
  <li>4 garlic cloves, minced</li>
  <li>1 cup chicken broth, or more as needed</li>
  <li>1 cup salsa</li>
  <li>4 cups milk</li>
  <li>1 pound penne pasta</li>
  <li>4 cups shredded Mexican 4-cheese blends</li>
 </ul>
 <h2>How to Make it Step-By-Step</h2>
 <ol>
  <li>Combine chili powder, cumin, salt, onion powder, garlic powder, and Mexican oregano in a small bowl for the seasoning blend. Season chicken with half of the seasoning; reserve remaining seasoning for later.

  </li>
  <li>Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add chicken strips and cook until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Transfer chicken to a plate.</li>
  <li>Heat remaining oil in the same pot. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until softened, about 2 minutes. Stir in 1 cup chicken broth and salsa, scraping the browned bits of food off the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon.

  </li>
  <li>Add milk and dry pasta to the pot and stir to combine. Add chicken and bell peppers on top and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a light simmer and cook, gently stirring every 4 to 5 minutes, until pasta is cooked through and sauce has thickened, about 20 minutes. Try and keep noodles as submerged as possible while cooking. If the consistency becomes too thick, add a bit more chicken broth.</li>
  <li>Season with remaining seasoning blend, to taste. Stir in Mexican cheese and combine until melted. Sprinkle with cilantro to serve.
